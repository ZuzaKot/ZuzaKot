- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ZuzaKot. I learn programming since autumn 2019.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, developing and creating everything I can imagine.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming in C# and designing software architecture.
- I have got little experience with front-end (html5+css3+js) and back-end (C#, php5.6-php7 + mysql) also.
